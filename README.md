Lenses.csv is a table containing recently discovered astronomical lensed objects found at https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/castles/noimages.html

Cross.py is a python script that takes no arguments and reads from Lenses.csv.
The script will generate queries that I will be able to run on the SDSS Casjobs command line tool to produce tables containing primitive Einstein Cross models
